A bunch of tools to help the GM of a Foundry VTT game.

Right click an item in the sidebar and choose "Change Item Type" to change its type to any of the DnD5e types.

Right click a journal in the sidebar and choose "Search for Table" to search this journal for any tables. Format the output in the dialog and create a rolltable from each table foound.

Right click a journal folder in the sidebar and choose "Search for Tables" to search all journals in the folder for tables.

Click the "RWK Table Import" button in the rolltable sidebar to bring up a dialog with a window in which a HTML table can be pasted. The output can be set and the result is a rolltable from the HTML. Useful to convert DnDBeyond tables into rolltables quickly. Just inspect the table on the DnDBeyond webpage, right click on the <table> element and click "copy -> copy element" and paste (CTRL_V) the table element into the paste window. Give the table a name then hit Convert!


There is now a keyboard shortcut to toggle the Sidebar : CTRL+S
